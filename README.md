> Nuxt.js project

This is the website source code for the [illustrarama.com](https://www.illustrarama.com) site. This is written in javascript using [nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/).

This a rebooted repository as all the api keys were hardcoded, that is why it is not possible to see all the previous commits. There were 93 commits before.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
